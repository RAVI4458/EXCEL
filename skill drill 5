🚀 Skill Drill 5: Mastering Advanced XLOOKUP



✅ Topics Practiced



1.Basic XLOOKUP usage (syntax, table setup).

2.Returning all columns (horizontal & vertical lookups).

3.Wildcard lookups (values that begin with / contain).

4.Comparison lookups (equal to / higher than).

5.Multiple condition lookups.

6.Lookup between two dates.

7.Finding highest / lowest values.

8.Advanced lookups (second matching value, multiple matches).

9.Returning multiple columns at once.



🎯 Key Learnings

Flexibility over VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP → Unlike older functions, XLOOKUP can return values from any direction (left, right, up, down).

Wildcard support → Helps in partial string matching, very useful when data isn’t clean.

Conditional lookups → You can replicate complex queries inside Excel without needing SQL.

Range-based lookups (between dates) → Great for analyzing time-based datasets.

Multiple results → Ability to fetch all matching rows instead of just the first one.

Performance in dashboards → Makes Excel models cleaner, easier to maintain, and interview-ready.



💡 Why It’s Important for Interviews



👉Demonstrates problem-solving with data → Recruiters want to see how you’d handle messy or real-world datasets.



👉Shows advanced Excel knowledge → Many BI / analyst roles still test Excel before SQL/Power BI.



👉Highlights adaptability → Knowing tricks like “lookup between dates” or “multiple conditions” shows you can go beyond basic lookups.



👉Gives you an edge → Most candidates stop at VLOOKUP — using XLOOKUP proves you stay updated with modern tools.
