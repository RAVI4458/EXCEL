COUNTIFS

AVERAGEIFS

XLOOKUP

MAXIFS

INDEX + MATCH

FILTER

MAX

LARGE

Choosing the right formula for the problem

Working with wildcards & patterns

Using date ranges in criteria

Handling multiple conditions

Combining formulas to tackle complex problems

📝 Practice Questions I solved:

Total downloads for Sugar Rush

Total downloads for C apps

Uninstalls in December 2021

Downloads in Oct, Nov, Dec 2021

How many times we had more than 8000 downloads per app month?

5 star rating % for Sugar Rush

Average uninstalls for Subway Wafers

Which month has the highest uninstall ratio?

Average monthly downloads

Most downloads in any month/app? 2nd and 3rd places also?

Which month and app was that?

In October 2021, which app has most 1-star ratings?

Does it change by December 2021?

What are the best download figures for each app?

What is the least downloaded app in each month?

📈 This practice made me more confident at applying Excel to real-world data analysis challenges. It’s exciting to see how much faster and smarter decisions can be made with the right formulas!


Skill Drill – 4: Mastering Lookups in Excel 🔍

Today’s focus was on taking my lookup skills a step further.

 We all start with VLOOKUP, but to handle real-world data challenges, I explored how to go beyond it using INDEX + MATCH and some powerful tricks.

🔑 Key takeaways from today’s drill:

 1️⃣ Pattern Matching – using wildcards (*) with VLOOKUP for flexible lookups.

 2️⃣ Looking up in Two Tables – with IFERROR(VLOOKUP(...), VLOOKUP(...)) to search across multiple ranges.

 3️⃣ Multi-column Results – fetching multiple outputs instead of just one column.

 4️⃣ Combine All Matches – using TEXTJOIN + IF to return all matching values.

 5️⃣ A Better Function – exploring INDEX + MATCH for more control and flexibility.

💡 Learning: VLOOKUP is great for basics, but INDEX + MATCH (and later XLOOKUP) gives much more power and adaptability.

I’ll continue practicing these small drills daily – because consistency builds confidence. 🚀
